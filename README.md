# Problem Statement
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. 
* You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. 
* For each training example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision. 
* Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.

## Solution
  
### Logisitic Regression Model
Our goal is to build a logistic regression model to fit this data.
- With this model, we can then predict if a new student will be admitted based on their scores on the two exams.
  
For logistic regression, the model is represented as

  𝑓(𝑥)=𝑔(𝐰⋅𝐱+𝑏)

where function $g$ is the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function is defined as:

$$g(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$
